### Run the server

### Considerations

- A new screen called `Checkout` was added to expand the user flow
- Some modifications about CTAs has been made to improve user flow and user experience

### Next Steps

- Create a custom hook for pagination
- Rearrange design tokens and abstract them with Sass tools
